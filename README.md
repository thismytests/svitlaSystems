# Alpha FX Senior Front End Test

## The exercise

We would like you to get the data from the API and present it in the page/s as well as save data to the API. Imagine you are creating an application for production - the UX/UI must look professional and clean.

The content is based on football teams and each team has a few games and teams linked to them. This is meant to be a bit of fun to demonstrate what you know (or can learn) about the technologies we have asked for. There is no right or wrong answer, apart from using jQuery :wink:

## The end result

The end result should be able to demonstrate the following as a minimum:

| Page | Description |
|------|------|
| `Teams Page` | This will display all team names, when you click on one it will take you to team info (below) |
| `Team Info` | This will display team info, all players and games played for the specified team |
| `Player Statistics` | This will display information about a specified player. (Age, nationality, history, etc.) |

You can have each of the above as separate pages, or have them show/hide when necessary, either on one page or via modals (or similar). You should use components where possible.

## The basic functionality required:
1. Create a Vue app that is navigatable to access all the required data.
2. Get all the teams and present the information on a page via a component.
3. Create the functionality to click on a team and display the players and games for that team via a component.
4. Create the functionality to add a new game result for a team (see API end points), ideally via a component.
5. Create the functionality to click on a player and display their playing club history via a component.
6. Error handling, e.g. page not found, invalid requests etc.

## Bonus points:
1. Show the club logo image in the team page as well as the colour associated to that team (you can set just the background colour or you can get creative!).
2. Display all the dates and amounts in the right format (dd/mm/yy and xxx,xxx,xxx.xx) - you can assume all monetry values are in Â£ (GBP).
3. Build a filter that allows you to search for players by any field, ideally multiple filters at the same time.
4. Calculate the total goals and points for each team (being the points calculated as 3 for a victory, 1 for a tie and 0 for a loss).
5. Validation on adding a new game result - including not allowing the date to be in the future.
6. Basic README file explaining how to run your app.


## The Rules

1. You can install any package or use any external source you like.
2. You must use Vue.js, you cannot use jQuery.
3. You can add any styles you wish, SCSS preferred.
4. You have to make a single page application using Vue.js.
5. You can use ES5, ES6 or ES7 (ES6+ preferred).
6. You should ensure your application installs and runs correctly on a fresh path.

## How the app works

_* You only have to work in the Vue App front-end, all functionality is already done in the API_

For a detailed explanation on Vue.js, check out the [Vue Documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

## API

> We recommend using HTTP request software (such as Postman or Insomnia) to test out the endpoint request/responses.

[Download Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

[Download Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

The base URL for the api is:

```
https://alphafx-code-test-api.herokuapp.com/
```

The API is open so, no API key or other headers need to be passed in (unless specified).

##### All data should be assumed to be sent in the POST body (wrapped inside a JSON object) with the following headers:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
